      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <hr />
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 ounces fettuccine</li>
        <li>Olive oil, for tossing</li>
        <li>12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 2)</li>
        <li>1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <hr />
      <br />
      <ul>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <li>
          Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. Add the
          pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente (tender
          but still slightly firm). Drain and toss with a splash of oil.
        </li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 1/4-inch-thick strips, and lay them
          on a plate or a sheet of waxed paper. Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <li>
          Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the
          butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high and add
          the chicken in 1 layer. Cook, without moving the pieces, until the
          underside has browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the pieces, and cook until
          browned and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the chicken
          to a medium bowl.
        </li>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <li>
          Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter.
          Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any
          browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream
          and nutmeg and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the
          heat to keep the sauce just warm.
        </li>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <li>
          Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the chicken and
          cooked pasta and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot in
          heated bowls.
        </li>
