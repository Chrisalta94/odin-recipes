            Bringing ramen home takes a trip to an Asian market, three days of
            <br />
            work, and your largest pot, but this low-stress (really!) labor of
            <br />
            love might be the best soup you'll ever make.

      <h2>PREPARATION</h2>
      <br />
      <h3>INGREDIENT INFO</h3>
      <hr />
      <ul>
        <br />
        <h4>KOMBU DASHI AND TARE</h4>
        <br />
        <li>
          Step 1: Two days ahead: For the dashi, combine kombu and 4 quarts cold
          water in a large bowl. Cover and let sit at room temperature at least
          8 hours and up to 12 hours. For the tare, combine soy sauce, sake, and
          mirin in a small bowl; cover and chill.
        </li>
        <br />
        <h4>PORK AND STOCK</h4>
        <br />
        <li>
          Step 2: One day ahead: Season pork shoulder with salt and pepper. Roll
          up and tie with kitchen twine at 2” intervals. (This helps keep the
          meat intact while cooking and makes for round, compact slices.)
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Step 3: Heat oil in a large heavy pot (at least 8 quarts) over
          medium-high heat Cook pork shoulder, turning, until brown all over,
          10–12 minutes. Add chicken, spareribs, scallions, carrots, garlic,
          ginger, and bonito flakes. Remove kombu from dashi; discard. Add as
          much kombu dashi as will fit in pot once liquid is boiling (reserve
          remaining dashi). Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, skimming
          the surface occasionally and adding remaining dashi as liquid reduces,
          until pork shoulder is tender and stock has reduced to about 2 quarts,
          2½–3 hours.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Step 4: Remove pork shoulder from stock and let cool. Wrap tightly in
          plastic and chill until ready to use. (Chilling pork will make meat
          easier to slice.) Strain stock through a fine-mesh sieve into another
          large pot or a large bowl or container; discard solids (including ribs
          and chicken). Cover and chill.
        </li>
        <br />
        <h4>RAMEN AND GARNISHES</h4>
        <br />
        <li>
          Step 5: Bring a medium pot of water to a boil. Carefully add eggs one
          at a time and boil gently for 7 minutes. (Egg yolks should be shiny
          yellow and almost jammy; egg white should be just set.) Drain eggs and
          transfer to a bowl of ice water to stop cooking; let cool. Peel; set
          aside.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Step 6: Remove string and thinly slice pork; cover and set aside.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Step 7: When ready to serve, bring stock to a simmer; it should be
          very hot. At the same time, cook noodles in a large pot of boiling
          water according to package directions until al dente; drain (no need
          to salt the water, as ramen noodles contain more salt than pasta).
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Step 8: Just before serving, divide noodles among 6 deep bowls. Top
          with sliced pork, placing it off to one side. Add tare to hot stock
          and ladle over pork to warm through (stock should come up just to the
          level of the noodles).
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Step 9: Place a small pile of menma next to pork. Halve eggs and place
          next to menma. Place a small pile of sliced scallions next to egg.
          Tuck half a sheet of nori between side of bowl and noodles so it’s
          just poking out.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Step 10: Serve ramen with chili oil, sesame oil, and shichimi
          togarashi.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Step 11: DO AHEAD: Eggs can be cooked 1 day ahead. Keep unpeeled eggs
          covered in cool water. Cover and chill.
        </li>
      </ul>
