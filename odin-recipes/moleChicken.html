            Smelling and tasting each one, including the chiles, to create a
            <br />
            connection with each—and to learn how to build
            <br />
            the flavors that make a great mole. The payoff is a luscious and
            <br />
            complex sauce that drapes over tender chicken.

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <hr />
      <br />
      <ol>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <li>
          Bring 8 cups water and 1/2 tablespoon salt to a boil in a large
          stockpot over high. Reduce heat to medium-low, and add chicken. Cook
          until chicken is tender and a thermometer inserted in thickest portion
          of meat registers 155°F, about 30 minutes. Remove chicken; set aside
          on a large plate. Reserve 4 cups chicken cooking liquid in a large
          heatproof bowl; discard remaining cooking liquid.
        </li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <li>
          Heat 1/4 cup vegetable oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high. Add
          8 garlic cloves; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1
          minute. Add tomatoes, onions, and 1/2 tablespoon salt; cook, stirring
          occasionally, until onions are translucent and softened, about 8
          minutes. Transfer mixture to a blender. Secure lid on blender, and
          remove center piece to allow steam to escape. Place a kitchen towel
          over opening in lid. Process until smooth, about 1 minute. Transfer
          mixture to a large bowl, and set aside.
        </li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <li>
          Wipe skillet clean. Add 3 cups vegetable oil; heat over medium-high.
          Working with a few different types of chiles at a time, place in a
          spider, and submerge in hot oil for 2 seconds per batch. Remove from
          oil using spider, and place in a large heat-proof bowl. Repeat with
          remaining chiles and remaining 4 garlic cloves.
        </li>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <li>
          Place sesame seeds and pepitas in a medium metal strainer; submerge in
          hot oil in skillet over medium-high. Cook, stirring mixture inside
          strainer and shaking occasionally, until seeds are golden brown and
          fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer seed mixture to bowl with Chile
          mixture.
        </li>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <li>
          Working with 1 tortilla at a time, add to hot oil in skillet over
          medium-high. Cook, turning occasionally, until golden brown, 30
          seconds to 1 minute. Transfer fried tortillas to a plate lined with
          paper towels; let cool 5 minutes. Break into 2-inch pieces. (Strained
          and cooled oil may be reused for frying.)
        </li>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <li>
          Add chile mixture, tortilla pieces, and bolillo pieces to reserved 4
          cups chicken cooking liquid in bowl. Let stand until liquid is almost
          absorbed and bolillo has softened, about 10 minutes. Transfer mixture
          to a blender; process until smooth, about 1 minute.
        </li>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <li>
          Heat remaining 1/2 cup vegetable oil in a large pot over medium. Add
          tomato mixture; cook, stirring constantly, until heated through, about
          1 minute. Add blended chile mixture and chocolate disk. Bring to a
          simmer over medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until chocolate
          has melted and mixture is well combined, about 20 minutes. Add cooked
          chicken and remaining 1 tablespoon salt; stir to submerge in mole.
          Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and simmer until chicken is heated
          through, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve with rice and tortillas, and garnish
          with additional sesame seeds.
